# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
- **User Feedback**: Hardcoding stage 4 is bad. Need a menu.
- **Solution**: 
    -   Parameterize `GameEngine.start()`.
    -   Add buttons to HTML.
    -   Style them.

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
- **Engine**: `start(stageIdx = 0)` sets `playTime` to `STAGES[stageIdx].time`.
- **UI**: A grid of 5 buttons: [幽暗密林] [埋骨之地] ... [昆仑仙境].

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
Implementation Checklist:
1.  [ ] Modify `js/engine.js`: Update `start` method to handle `stageIdx` param.
2.  [ ] Modify `index.html`: Add stage buttons.
3.  [ ] Modify `css/style.css`: Style the buttons.
4.  [ ] Test: Use browser tools to click "昆仑仙境" and verify visuals.
